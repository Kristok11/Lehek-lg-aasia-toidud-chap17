          </p>
          <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <p>1 pound ground chicken</p>
          <p>1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs</p>
          <p>1/4 cup minced onion</p>
          <p>1/4 cup minced scallion</p>
          <p>1 egg</p>
          <p>1 tablespoon soy sauce</p>
          <p>1 tablespoon sake</p>
          <p>1 tablespoon sugar</p>
          <p>1 tablespoon cornstarch</p>
          <p>Salt and pepper</p>
          <p>Bamboo skewers</p>
          <p>Green onion, chopped (for garnish)</p>
          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <ol>
            <p>Soak bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine ground chicken, panko breadcrumbs, minced onion, minced scallion, egg, soy sauce, sake, cornstarch, salt, and pepper.</p>
            <p>Mix well with your hands until the mixture is evenly combined.</p>
            <p>Divide the mixture into 12-15 portions.</p>
            <p>Take each portion and shape it into a ball. Thread each ball onto a skewer.</p>
            <p>Preheat the grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.</p>
            <p>Grill the chicken meatballs for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through.</p>
            <p>In a small saucepan, combine sugar and soy sauce. Cook over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.</p>
            <p>Brush the sauce over the meatballs, and continue grilling for another 1-2 minutes, brushing with more sauce as necessary.</p>
            <p>Garnish with chopped green onion and serve hot.</p>
