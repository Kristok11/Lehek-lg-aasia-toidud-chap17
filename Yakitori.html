          <h2>How to Make Yakitori at Home</h2>
          <p>
            To make delicious Yakitori at home, you'll need some skewers and a
            grill. Start by preparing your ingredients, such as chicken,
            vegetables, and seasoning. Cut the chicken into small pieces and thread
            them onto the skewers, alternating with vegetables such as green onions
            or bell peppers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, season the skewers with a mix of soy sauce, mirin, sake, and
            sugar, or any other seasoning of your choice. Let the skewers marinate
            in the seasoning for at least an hour before grilling.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you're ready to cook, preheat your grill to medium-high heat.
            Place the skewers on the grill and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side,
            or until the chicken is fully cooked and the vegetables are tender.
            Make sure to brush the skewers with the remaining marinade as they
            cook.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once your Yakitori is ready, serve it hot with some additional sauce
            for dipping. Enjoy!
